## Quick Start

### Option 1: Use Pre-built Solution Packages (Fastest)

**For immediate deployment, download and import ready-to-use solution packages:**

1. **Download** the latest solution from [Releases](https://github.com/manojgaduparthi/DynamicGroupGrid/releases):
   - `DynamicGroupGrid_unmanaged.zip` - For development/testing environments
   - `DynamicGroupGrid_managed.zip` - For production environments

2. **Import** into your Power Platform environment:
   - Open Power Platform admin center → Solutions
   - Click "Import solution" and select the downloaded ZIP file
   - Follow the import wizard

3. **Add to your form** (see [Configuration](#configuration) section below)

### Option 2: Direct PCF Deployment (For Developers)

**Deploy directly to your environment using PAC CLI:**

```bash
# Prerequisites: Install Microsoft PowerPlatform CLI
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/powerapps-cli

# Navigate to project folder
cd DynamicGroupGrid

# Install dependencies and build
npm install
npm run build

# Authenticate to your environment
pac auth create --url https://yourorg.crm.dynamics.com

# Deploy to your environment  
pac pcf push --publisher-prefix [yourprefix]
```

### Option 3: Build Your Own Solution Package

**Create customized solution packages for your organization:**

#### Method A: Using This Repository's Solution Source

**Use the included solution structure for consistent packaging:**

```bash
# Clone and prepare
git clone https://github.com/manojgaduparthi/DynamicGroupGrid.git
cd DynamicGroupGrid

# Install dependencies and build the PCF control
npm install
npm run build

# Generate solution packages using included solution structure
pac solution pack --zipfile "releases/DynamicGroupGrid_unmanaged.zip" --folder "solution" --packagetype Unmanaged
pac solution pack --zipfile "releases/DynamicGroupGrid_managed.zip" --folder "solution" --packagetype Managed
```

#### Method B: Create From Scratch in Your Environment

**For organizations requiring specific publisher details:**

```bash
# Prerequisites: Microsoft PowerPlatform CLI installed and authenticated
pac auth create --url https://yourorg.crm.dynamics.com

# Build the control first
npm install
npm run build

# Create a new solution in your environment
pac solution init --publisher-name "YourCompany" --publisher-prefix "yourprefix" --output-directory "MyCustomSolution"

# Deploy the control to your environment
pac pcf push --publisher-prefix yourprefix

# Export solutions from your environment
pac solution export --name "DynamicGroupGrid" --path "DynamicGroupGrid_unmanaged.zip" --managed false
pac solution export --name "DynamicGroupGrid" --path "DynamicGroupGrid_managed.zip" --managed true
```

#### Method C: Automated Batch Generation

**Create a batch script for repeated solution generation:**

Create `generate-solutions.bat`:
```batch
@echo off
echo Building PCF Control...
npm run build

echo Generating Unmanaged Solution...
pac solution pack --zipfile "releases/DynamicGroupGrid_unmanaged.zip" --folder "solution" --packagetype Unmanaged

echo Generating Managed Solution...
pac solution pack --zipfile "releases/DynamicGroupGrid_managed.zip" --folder "solution" --packagetype Managed

echo Solution packages generated in releases/ folder
pause
```

Then run: `generate-solutions.bat`

## Configuration

### Adding to Model-Driven App Forms

1. **Open Form Designer**:
   - Navigate to Power Apps maker portal
   - Open your model-driven app
   - Edit the form where you want to add the control

2. **Add Subgrid Component**:
   - Click "+ Component" in the form designer
   - Select "Subgrid" from the list
   - Configure the data source (select entity and view)

3. **Configure Control**:
   - Go to the **Controls** tab in the subgrid properties
   - Click "Add Control" and search for "DynamicGroupGrid"
   - Set it as default for **Web** experience
   - Configure properties as needed (see [Input Properties](#input-properties) below)

4. **Bind Outputs (Optional)**:
   - Create text fields on the form to capture control outputs
   - Bind `selectedRecordId`, `selectedRecordIds`, and `rowEvent` outputs
   - Use these for custom ribbon commands or business logic

### Input Properties

Configure these properties in the control configuration:

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `pageSize` | Number | 25 | Records per page (1-100) |
| `enablePagination` | Boolean | true | Show pagination controls |

### Output Properties

Bind these outputs to form fields for advanced integration:

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `selectedRecordId` | Text | ID of the last selected record |
| `selectedRecordIds` | Text | Comma-separated list of all selected record IDs |
| `rowEvent` | Text | JSON event data containing record details and action type |

### Dataset Configuration

**Important**: Configure these dataset settings for optimal functionality:

- ✅ **Display Command Bar**: `true` (enables ribbon integration)
- ✅ **Display View Selector**: `true` (allows users to switch views)
- ✅ **Display Quick Find**: `true` (enables native search functionality)
- ✅ **Enable Filtering**: `true` (allows column filtering)

## Usage

### Basic Operations
- **Group by**: Use dropdown to select grouping column
- **Select records**: Click checkboxes or rows (Ctrl/Shift for multi-select)
- **Expand/collapse**: Click group headers
- **Resize columns**: Drag column borders
- **Navigate**: Double-click any record to open
- **Pagination**: Use navigation controls at bottom when dataset is large

### Advanced Integration

Use the sample consumer script (`samples/pcfConsumerSample.js`) to integrate with ribbon commands:

```javascript
// Example ribbon button action
pcfConsumerSample.openSelectedRecord(executionContext, "myControlName");
```

See `samples/README.md` for complete integration guide.

## Development & Customization

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v14+ recommended)
- **Microsoft PowerPlatform CLI** ([Installation Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/data-platform/powerapps-cli))
- **Power Platform environment** with PCF feature enabled

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/manojgaduparthi/DynamicGroupGrid.git
cd DynamicGroupGrid

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development with hot reload
npm start watch
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build optimized version
npm run build

# Build output will be in the out/ directory
```

### Solution Package Generation

**Using Repository Solution Structure (Recommended):**

This repository includes a pre-configured solution structure in the `solution/` folder that generates clean, minimal packages.

```bash
# Generate both packages
pac solution pack --zipfile "releases/DynamicGroupGrid_unmanaged.zip" --folder "solution" --packagetype Unmanaged
pac solution pack --zipfile "releases/DynamicGroupGrid_managed.zip" --folder "solution" --packagetype Managed
```

**Benefits of using the included solution structure:**
- ✅ Clean package structure (no extra folders)
- ✅ Minimal file size (~16KB)
- ✅ Generic publisher info (works with any environment)
- ✅ Includes only essential solution components

**Creating Custom Solution Packages:**

For organizations needing specific publisher details:

```bash
# Method 1: Create solution in your environment and export
pac auth create --url https://yourorg.crm.dynamics.com
pac pcf push --publisher-prefix yourprefix
pac solution export --name "YourSolutionName" --path "custom_unmanaged.zip" --managed false
pac solution export --name "YourSolutionName" --path "custom_managed.zip" --managed true

# Method 2: Modify the included solution structure
# Edit solution/Other/Solution.xml to update publisher details
# Then use pac solution pack as shown above
```

### Understanding Solution Structure

This repository includes a complete solution structure in the `solution/` folder:

```
solution/
├── Controls/                                    # PCF control files
│   └── new_DynamicGroupGrid.PCF.DynamicGroupGrid/
│       ├── bundle.js                           # Compiled control logic
│       ├── ControlManifest.xml                 # Control metadata
│       └── css/                                # Stylesheets
└── Other/                                      # Solution manifests
    ├── Customizations.xml                      # Defines included components
    └── Solution.xml                            # Solution metadata
```

**Key Solution Files:**

- **`Customizations.xml`**: Contains CustomControl definitions that tell the solution what PCF controls to include
- **`Solution.xml`**: Contains solution metadata like version, publisher, and display name
- **`Controls/`**: Contains the actual compiled PCF control files that get imported

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- ✅ **Environment Independent**: No environment-specific data embedded
- ✅ **Consistent**: Same package works across all environments
- ✅ **Minimal**: Only includes essential components (~16KB total)
- ✅ **Professional**: Clean structure suitable for distribution

### Customizing Solution Metadata

To create packages with your organization's branding:

1. **Edit `solution/Other/Solution.xml`**:
```xml
<ImportExportXml>
  <SolutionManifest>
    <UniqueName>YourOrgDynamicGroupGrid</UniqueName>
    <LocalizedNames>
      <LocalizedName description="Your Org Dynamic Group Grid" languagecode="1033" />
    </LocalizedNames>
    <Publisher>
      <UniqueName>YourOrgPublisher</UniqueName>
      <LocalizedNames>
        <LocalizedName description="Your Organization" languagecode="1033" />
      </LocalizedNames>
    </Publisher>
    <Version>1.0.0.0</Version>
  </SolutionManifest>
</ImportExportXml>
```

2. **Generate packages with your branding**:
```bash
pac solution pack --zipfile "YourOrg_DynamicGroupGrid_v1.0.zip" --folder "solution" --packagetype Managed
```

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

**Solution import fails**
- ✅ Verify you have System Administrator or System Customizer role
- ✅ Check that PCF controls are enabled in your environment
- ✅ Ensure the solution file is not corrupted (re-download if needed)
- ✅ Try importing the unmanaged version first for testing

**Control not available after import**
- ✅ Check that the solution import completed successfully (no warnings)
- ✅ Refresh your browser cache and try again
- ✅ Verify the control appears in the Components list in form designer

### Runtime Issues

**Control not loading on forms**
- ✅ Verify solution import completed successfully
- ✅ Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12 → Console)
- ✅ Ensure subgrid is properly configured with data source
- ✅ Confirm the entity view has sufficient privileges

**Selection not syncing with ribbon**
- ✅ Confirm dataset has "Display Command Bar" enabled
- ✅ Verify outputs are bound correctly to form fields
- ✅ Check if form has multiple datasets (naming conflicts)
- ✅ Test with a simple ribbon command first

**Column widths not persisting**
- ✅ Check localStorage is available and not disabled by IT policy
- ✅ Clear browser cache if widths seem stuck
- ✅ Verify control name consistency across sessions
- ✅ Test in incognito/private browsing mode

**Pagination not working**
- ✅ Verify `enablePagination` property is set to `true`
- ✅ Check that dataset has more records than `pageSize` setting
- ✅ Ensure proper view configuration with sufficient data

### Solution Generation Issues

**PAC solution pack fails**
- ✅ Ensure you're in the correct directory with `solution/` folder
- ✅ Check that all required files exist in `solution/Controls/` and `solution/Other/`
- ✅ Verify XML files are properly formatted (no encoding issues)
- ✅ Run `pac solution pack --help` for parameter validation

**Generated package doesn't contain control**
- ✅ Verify `solution/Other/Customizations.xml` has CustomControl definitions
- ✅ Check that control files exist in `solution/Controls/` directory
- ✅ Ensure control names match exactly between files
- ✅ Build the PCF control first with `npm run build`

**Package imports but control missing**
- ✅ Check solution import logs for warnings or errors
- ✅ Verify the CustomControl definition in Customizations.xml is correct
- ✅ Try importing unmanaged version first, then managed
- ✅ Ensure environment supports PCF controls (feature enabled)

### Development Issues

**Build errors during npm run build**
- ✅ Delete `node_modules/` and run `npm install` again
- ✅ Check Node.js version compatibility (v14+ recommended)
- ✅ Verify TypeScript compilation with `npm run build`
- ✅ Review error messages for missing dependencies

**Local testing with npm start watch**
- ✅ Ensure PowerPlatform CLI is installed and up to date
- ✅ Check that test harness loads without errors
- ✅ Verify manifest file syntax is correct
- ✅ Try clearing browser cache or using incognito mode

### Debug Mode

For development, uncomment mock data in `updateView()`:
```typescript
// const ds = this.getMockDataset(); // Uncomment for testing
```
